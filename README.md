# Movie Features Correlation

This Data Analytics project explores the correlation between different features in a movie dataset using the powerful Python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Correlation Analysis
Now that we have the data loaded, we can perform correlation analysis on different movie features to see how they relate to each other. We will use numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to create visualizations and gain insights.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the correlations between movie features, we can gain valuable insights into the relationships between different attributes of movies in the dataset.

Feel free to explore and analyze the data further to draw more interesting conclusions!
